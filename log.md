### R1D1-R1D2 March 27-28, Tuesday-Wednesday

**Thoughts:** Need to make reminder for this log, because totaly forgot to write it yesterday. 

### R1D3 March 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on main page for blog. Finished slider and start portfolio gallery.

**Today's Progress:** Yesterday tried to finish main page for this blogoportfolio site. But no ) Today did some work on Udemy React Course although it's just copy-past tutorial stuff.

### R1D6-R1D8 April 1-3, Sunday-Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** More progress on the blogoportfolio site. Done with markup, need to finish some effects yet. Also finished first little project for React Course (it's not mine, it's just copy-paste with some playing about it).

### R1D9 April 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Today decided to redesign the portfolio site, LOL. Done with markup for the main page, have some ideas about gallery page. Hope, it will look cool. Also spent some time to work on React course - about React Router and Lifecycles. 

**Thoughts:** React is still easy. It's a little bit frustrating, have the feeling like I missed smth here.

### R1D10 April 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Spent more time on React Course.

**Thoughts:** It will so hard and busy day, but I can manage to do my study work for these challenge. So proud of myself. 

### R1D11-R1D12 April 6-7, Friday-Saturday

**Today's Progress:** More React Course.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just some more information about lifecycles.

### R1D13 April 8, Sunday and Easter!

**Today's Progress:** It was pretty much lazy day, and Easter by the way - you can't work at Easter, it's a sin! :). And I was tired of this React, so decided to do some easy markup stuff. Taked a course about Advanced CSS and done some work from the first project by myself, than checked it with original materials from the tutorial (CSS-animation, vertical align with transform and some other style tips, also watched cool videos about parsing CSS).

**Thoughts:** It's a really good practice than you're trying to redo tutorial code by yourself after watching video instead of just copy-paste it. Need to try it with React course.

### R1D14 April 9, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Still walking through this Advanced CSS course and making a template with some animation and other funny stuff.

**Thoughts:** It's kinda rest for me but I've learned some useful thing, for example, Sass and three principles of good markup. Also it has many little tips for cool style.

### R1D15 April 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Tried to finish the first project of Advanced CSS course but don't, not today. Did like 2/3 of it.

**Thoughts:** Sass is really cool thing, and it work well with BEM. Also the course has some really cool tips and tricks in CSS that I didn't know. But I need to come back to React course and my freelance job.

### R1D16-17 April 11-12, Wednesday-Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Well, I needed to review Wordpress for my teaching job, so was reviewing for two days. 

**Thoughts:** It' so much easier than the first time :) For example, I remember that I was so confused when install WP then. Now is really easy, don't understand what was so hard?

### R1D18 April 14, Saturday

Missed yesterday, sorry. It was totally shit day, so many troubles happend. (Friday 13, indeed)

**Today's Progress:** Finished MarkUp for the first project of this CSS course. Only responsive part is left to do.

**Thoughts:** At last!

### R1D19 April 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed my knowledge of React. It was not so wast, actually, LOL.

**Thoughts:** So, it was really tough week for me. But it's ok. I supposed to learn React, but have no energy for this and decided to do smth easy than do nothing. And this course about CSS and Sass was surprisingly usefull! So many little hacks for styles. My markup is nicer now. Good. Let's hack React in the next week!

P.S. My writing in English is awfull. Need to work on it too.

### R1D20 April 16, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Add media queries to the project for Advanced CSS course. Also watched some React course videos. 

**Thoughts:** Media queries with Sass and mixins are really cool. I like it :) Also, at last, my commit on git makes sense, because I added it out of order or any sense in the past. Need to learn make meaningful and neat commits.

### R1D21 April 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Add responsive images to the project for Advanced CSS course. Also continue to watch and read React. 

**Thoughts:** There are so many little things in CSS and HTML that I don't know. Srcset-attribute was one of them. Now it's not.

### R1D22 April 18, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress:** Read about npm. Created a simple build process for CSS course project.
