# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D0: March 26, Monday
**Thoughts:** So, plans for now - finish ReactFullStack Course on Udemy and work on sites for my freelance job.

### R1D1-R1D2 March 27-28, Tuesday-Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on main page for blog. Done some markup and also started slider with typing effect. 

**Thoughts:** Need to make reminder for this log, because totaly forgot to write it yesterday. 

### R1D3 March 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on main page for blog. Finished slider and start portfolio gallery.

**Thoughts:** I hope I could start and finish my coding hours early, because I need more sleep.

### R1D4-R1D5 March 30-31, Friday-Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Yesterday tried to finish main page for this blogoportfolio site. But no ) Today did some work on Udemy React Course although it's just copy-past tutorial stuff.

**Thoughts:** Well, I'm able to code every day, but have some problems with this log. Damn.

### R1D6-R1D8 April 1-3, Sunday-Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** More progress on the blogoportfolio site. Done with markup, need to finish some effects yet. Also finished first little project for React Course (it's not mine, it's just copy-paste with some playing about it).

**Thoughts:** Need to figured out how to write this log everyday. Also React isn't hard at all yet. We'll see what's next.

### R1D9 April 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Today decided to redesign the portfolio site, LOL. Done with markup for the main page, have some ideas about gallery page. Hope, it will look cool. Also spent some time to work on React course - about React Router and Lifecycles. 

**Thoughts:** React is still easy. It's a little bit frustrating, have the feeling like I missed smth here.

### R1D10 April 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Spent more time on React Course.

**Thoughts:** It will so hard and busy day, but I can manage to do my study work for these challenge. So proud of myself. 

### R1D11-R1D12 April 6-7, Friday-Saturday

**Today's Progress:** More React Course.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special. Just some more information about lifecycles.

### R1D13 April 8, Sunday and Easter!

**Today's Progress:** It was pretty much lazy day, and Easter by the way - you can't work at Easter, it's a sin! :). And I was tired of this React, so decided to do some easy markup stuff. Taked a course about Advanced CSS and done some work from the first project by myself, than checked it with original materials from the tutorial (CSS-animation, vertical align with transform and some other style tips, also watched cool videos about parsing CSS).

**Thoughts:** It's a really good practice than you're trying to redo tutorial code by yourself after watching video instead of just copy-paste it. Need to try it with React course.
