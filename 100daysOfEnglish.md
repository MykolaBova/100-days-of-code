# 100 Days Of English - Log

### R1D0: February 17, Sunday
**Thoughts:** Ok, the previous log about code was helpfull and funny. I had fun and also had a new job, 
cooool (as programmer, aha). So, let's try this thing with English. Also I'm going to start a new
100DaysOfCode. Read my last year log, by the way - English,where you were then? 
Why I always used imperative mood instead of Past Tense (like "add this stuff", 
dummy, you've already done it, ha-ha-ha). Ok, I hope, I will be laught about this notes in a couple month,
because I will be sooo cool in English. Yes, dude, let's crack it! 

### R1D1: February 17, Sunday

**Time**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Practiced sounds i/i: a lot. Also created a Memrise cards from my last lesson and practiced them
(I have private English lessons twice per week).
**Thoughts:** Why my school English teacher said me that these two i sounds the same and differ only in their length?
I hate you.
